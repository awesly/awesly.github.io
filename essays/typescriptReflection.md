Typescript is an essential tool for effective use of Javascript. As a sophomore in university for Computer Science, I have had a long journey to becoming the programmer I am today, which has informed my perspective on and use of Typescript. My current studies are also challenging me to grow as a programmer and professional, which is essential for my future career success.

The first exposure to programming I had in my education was a middle school club one of my best friends was an active member, in called Cyber Patriots. Students learned cyber security and competed against teams from other schools. While interesting in concept to me, I never participated because at that time the mentor and all of the members were boys, and I knew they would not welcome me. Later on, in high school there was a teacher that came to my freshman geometry math class and gave us a spiel for taking his computer science classes, and he emphasized that computer science needs diverse perspectives to grow, and also for computer science to be able to serve diverse needs. It's a fond memory of mine, yet it still took me until the Covid-19 pandemic that I, somewhat isolated from other people that could have intimidated me away from computer science, decided to take that first class in it. It was AP Computer Science Principles, and from the beginning I knew it was something I'd like to pursue as a career. Though it was meant to be only foundational and we began learning to program with "block coding" on Code.org - made for children - it definitely did get my foot in the door and helped me to understand those important fundamentals of computer science. Even better, was the impact that that teacher had on me, because he carried his empowering message through to the way he ran his class - he gave us some democratic power, let us have a reasonable amount of fun, and notably stood up for me once when a group of boys was talking during my presentation for code review, telling them that they were being disrespectful and that if they acted like that in the workforce people would think they were mysogynists and wouldn't want to work with, or hire them. 

Next in the list of computer science classes I took was Python, from the very same teacher. Through that class I gained a deeper understanding of programming and the ability to independently takle my coding problems. By then I had made my decision, that I would be going to UH Manoa and majoring in Computer Science. Once at Manoa, I took
